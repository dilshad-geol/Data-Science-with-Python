    "1. **Intro to Images**\n",
    "- **Pixel**\n",
    "  - Basic unit of Images\n",
    "    - a minute area of illumination on a display screen, one of many from which an image is composed\n",
    "  - Co-pixel\n",
    "  - Adjacent Pixel\n",
    "  - Un affected Pixel\n",
    "  - **BGR** color scheme identifies a pixels values appearance.\n",
    "- **Screen Size**\n",
    "  - VGA (640 * 769)pixels\n",
    "  - SXGA (1280 * 1024)pixels\n",
    "  - HDTV (1920 * 1080)pixels\n",
    "  - 4K (3840 x 2160)pixels\n",
    "  - 8K (7680 x 4320 pixels)\n",
    "- **Bits or Bit Depth**\n",
    "  - BIT DEPTH is determined by the number of bits used to define each pixel. The greater the bit depth, the number of tones (grayscale or color) that can be represented. Digital images may be produced in black and white (bitonal), grayscale, or color.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      - Black & White images:\n",
    "        - Binary Levels\n",
    "          - black = 0\n",
    "          - white = 1\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      - In a 2-bit image, there are four possible combinations: 00,01,10,and 11. if \"00\" represents black, and '11' represents white, then \"01\" equals dark gray and \"10\" equals light gray. The bit depth is two, but number of tones that can be represented is 2^2 or 4. At 8-bits, 256(2^8) different tones can be assigned to each pixel.\n",
    "      - Calculating bits:\n",
    "        - Grey Scale\n",
    "          - Multi level img 8 bit 2^8 =256 tones\n",
    "          - black = 0\n",
    "          - Grey = 1-255\n",
    "          - white= 256\n",
    "  - A color image is typically represented by a bit depth ranging from 8 to 24 or higher. With a 24-bit image, the bits are often divide into three groupings: 8 fro red, 8 fro green, 8 for blue. Combinations of these bits are used to represent other colors. A 24-bit image offers 16.7 million 2^24 color values.\n",
    "  - 3 kinds of images:\n",
    "    - bitonal\n",
    "    - grayscale\n",
    "    - RGB **BGR** (Open cv used BGR conventions)\n",
    "  - No. of tones in an image\n",
    "    - 1 bit (2^ 1) = 2tones\n",
    "    - 2 bits (2^ 2) = 4 tones\n",
    "    - 3 bits (2^ 3) = 8 tones\n",
    "    - 4 bits (2^ 4) = 16 tones\n",
    "    - 8 bits (2^ 8) = 256 tones\n",
    "    - 16 bits (2^ 16) = 65536 tones\n",
    "    - 24 bits (2^ 24)= 16.7 million tones\n",
    "2. **Intro to Video**\n",
    "- Sequence of images\n",
    "- Frames per Second (fps)\n",
    "  - 60fps (smoother image)\n",
    "  - 24fps (blurred)\n",
    "  - 15fps (very bad quality)\n",
    "    - 60fps x 60   :  3600 frame\n",
    "    - 15fps  x 60  :  900 frame\n",
    "    - 24fps  x 60  :  1440 frame\n",
    "  - Detecting images is similar to videos **but** we have to do tracking so that we dont miss an object.\n",
    "3. **Installing OpenCV in Python**\n",
    "- use command in windows/linux: pip install opencv-python\n",
    "- use command in Mac: pip3 install opencv-python\n",
