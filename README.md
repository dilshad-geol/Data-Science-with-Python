# **DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON**

offered by:
- **Codanics**

in collaboration with

- **University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan**
- **Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum**
- **Talon Institute of higher Studies**
- **University of Education, Lahore**
- **Scholarship Network (Facebook Group)**

This online course enabled learners to use Python, Git, and Markdown - for data science and machine learning --to develop participants understanding with real world projects and hand-on practicals which will allow them to use publicly available databases to analyze and interpret information and build analytical insights as results. This course also encompassed the development of soft skills to buils their online professional presence.


## **Introduction to the Course:**

This course covers basic and applied understanding of python for data science from the very begining to advanced levels. It explains the use of basic Data Science tools, i.e. Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Git for code version control. The role of Python for Data Visualization, Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Image & Video Analysis, and Machine Learning while working on exciting real life projects.

Data was collected during live sessions for machine learning chanllenges to give a complete sense of data science methodology to the students. Sessions were included to improve publications, to improve communications and workshop included to teach students how to show professional presence on social media platform and how to engage with like minded people within their fields. This course was attended by more then 120 students from varsatile backgrounds.
