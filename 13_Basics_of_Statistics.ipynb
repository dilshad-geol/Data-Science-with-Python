    "\n",
    "**Variable Type -1**\n",
    "- **Categorical(Nominal)**:\n",
    "    - Binominal: simply 2 values or relationship discussed(true or false, yes or no)\n",

    "- A **measurement** is a number or attribute computed for each member of a population or of a sample. The measurements of sample elements are collectively called sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **parameter** is a number that summarizes some aspect of the population as a whole.\n",
    "- A **statistic** is a number computed from the sample data.\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics** is the branch of statistics that involves organizing, diplaying, and describing data.\n",
    "- **Inferential statistics** is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from the population.\n",
    "- A **population** is any specific collection of objects of interest.\n",
    "- Any **sample** is any subset or sub-collection of population, including the case that the sample connsists of the whole population, in which case it is termed a census.\n",
    "- **Qualitative data** are measurements for which there is no natural numerical scale, but which consists of attributes, labels, or other non-numerical characteristics.\n",
    "- **Quantitative data** are numerical measurements that arise from a natural numerical scale.\n",
    "- **Mean** is the sum divided by the number of observations(Average). The mean is the average or the most common value in a collection of numbers.\n",

    "- **Median** is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers.\n",
    "      - The median is unique for each dataset\n",
    "      - Outliers dont have any effect on median\n",
    "      - Ratios, intervals and ordinal data has best use.\n",
