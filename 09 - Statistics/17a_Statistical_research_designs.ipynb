    "- Each experimental unit is randomly assigned to one of the treatments.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - we have 20 goats, so we provide them food 1 and food 2 half and half of goats. so making such categories and then experimenting is an example of CRD.\n",
    "**2- Randomized Complete Block Design(RCBD)**\n",
    "- Two step process:\n",
    "  - Make the block\n",
    "  - Repeat the smae thing from CRD\n",

    "**3- Latin Square Design (LSD)**:\n",
    "- Similar to square\n",
    "- Rows = Columns\n",

    "  - 2*2\n",
